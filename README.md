# AI-Powered Schema Generator

## Overview
This project is an **AI-powered Schema Generator** built using **Node.js, React, and Express** with **MongoDB** as the primary database. The application is designed to help generate database schemas dynamically using AI. To simplify deployment, **Docker and Docker Compose** are used to containerize the services and streamline the process of shipping to production.

## Technology Stack
- **Frontend**: React
- **Backend**: Node.js with Express
- **Database**: MongoDB
- **AI Integration**: Gemini AI
- **Containerization**: Docker & Docker Compose

## Design Decisions & Technology Choices
- **MongoDB** was chosen for its flexibility in handling dynamic schemas and unstructured data.
- **Node.js and Express** provide a scalable and lightweight backend for handling API requests efficiently.
- **React** is used for building a responsive and dynamic frontend.
- **Docker & Docker Compose** ensure consistent and easy deployment across different environments.
- **Gemini AI** is used for AI-powered schema generation, making data handling more adaptable and automated.
- **Environment Variables**: Sensitive credentials (API keys, database URIs) are securely stored in an `.env` file.
- **Authentication**: JWT is used for authentication, ensuring secure user sessions.
- **OAuth Integration**: OAuth is implemented for seamless login into apps, improving user experience.
- **UI Design**: The frontend follows a minimalist and user-friendly design approach to enhance usability.

## AI Integration
The application integrates **Gemini AI** via its SDK. The SDK is installed in the Node.js backend and is responsible for communicating with Gemini's servers. The AI is leveraged for generating database schemas dynamically based on user input. The process follows these steps:
1. User provides structured input through the frontend.
2. The backend provides Gemini AI with a predefined schema structure to follow.
3. Gemini AI generates a database schema that aligns with the given structure and user input.
4. The generated schema is then stored in MongoDB for future use and retrieval.

## Storage Mechanism
- **MongoDB** is used for storing AI-generated schemas and application data.
- The schemas generated by Gemini AI are stored in MongoDB collections, allowing for structured and efficient retrieval.
- MongoDB's flexible document-based structure enables seamless adaptation to evolving AI-generated schemas.

## Setup & Running the Project

### Prerequisites
Ensure you have the following installed:
- **Node.js** (v16+ recommended)
- **Docker & Docker Compose**
- **MongoDB** (or use a cloud MongoDB instance like MongoDB Atlas)

### Installation

#### Step 1: Clone the Repository
Clone the project repository and navigate into the project directory.

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/your-repo/your-project.git
cd your-project
```
#### Step 2: Set Up Environment Variables

Create a .env file in the project root and provide the necessary configuration variables:
```bash
env
Copy
Edit
SERVER_PORT=

GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID=
GOOGLE_CLIENT_SECRET=

GITHUB_CLIENT_ID=
GITHUB_CLIENT_SECRET=

MONGO_IP=
MONGO_USER=
MONGO_PASSWORD=
MONGO_PORT=

JWT_SECRET=

SERVER_URL=

GEMINI_API_KEY=

```

###### Important: Before authentication can work, you must create OAuth accounts on GitHub and Google to obtain the required credentials.

#### Step 3: Run the Application
Use the following command to start the application with Docker:

```bash

docker-compose -f ./docker-compose.dev.yml -f ./docker-compose.yml up --build
```
This will start both the backend and frontend services using Docker, making the application ready to run in your local environment.
